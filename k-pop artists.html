  <p>K/DA is a virtual girl group consisting of Kai'Sa, Evelynn, Ahri, and Akali. </p>

<div class= "row mt-3">
  <p>  The conception of K/DA was based on Riot's expressed desire to create more musical content in the future, with the characters chosen based on K-pop archetypes. The band was created to promote the League World Championship and to sell in-game K/DA skins of the characters in League of Legends. K/DA has subsequently achieved significant popularity both within and beyond that of the League of Legends fandom, and has received critical acclaim, especially with regards to their performance during the World Championship and the impact of gaming on the music scene. </p>

Their next single, "TT", from their third EP Twicecoaster: Lane 1, topped the Gaon charts for four consecutive weeks. The EP was the highest selling Korean girl group album of 2016. Within 19 months after debut, Twice had already sold over 1.2 million units of their four EPs and special album.

    <p> NCT 127 (Korean: 엔시티 127; RR: ensiti il-i-chil; stylized in all caps) is the second sub-unit of the South Korean boy band NCT, formed and currently managed by SM Entertainment. Their unit name is a combination of the acronym for Neo Culture Technology which is the meaning for their parental group's unlimited members, and as the unit is localized in Seoul, hence the number "127" representing the longitude coordinate of the city.[3] Originally debuted on July 1, 2016, the unit's original line up was composed of seven members: Taeil, Taeyong (leader), Yuta, Jaehyun, Winwin, Mark, and Haechan for their debut extended play NCT #127, which was a commercial success upon its release and earned the unit several nominations, eventually won them the Best New Group title at several South Korea music awards in 2016. Member Doyoung and Johnny then joined the unit in December 2016, ahead of their next extended play Limitless in 2017. Jungwoo was then introduced as the tenth and latest member to the unit in September 2018, followed by the group's first studio album Regular-Irregular later in October 2018. The ten-member unit is NCT's first fixed sub-unit, followed by the debut of Chinese-based unit WayV in early 2019. </p>
