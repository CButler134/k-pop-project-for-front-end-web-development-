    <h1>k-pop artists</h1>
    
    <div class= "col-lg">
    <p>Can we really talk K-pop without mentioning BTS? Don’t think so. BTS is arguably *the* most popular K-pop group around the globe, and with good reason. Their accolades include: Reaching number one on iTunes in more than 65 countries, have held first place on Billboard’s Social 50 chart for 114 weeks in a row, and absolutely crushed a U.S. stadium tour. </p>

    Wow, right? With three rappers (RM, Suga, and J-Hope) and four singers (Jin, Jimin, V and Jungkook) the group mixes hip-hop, pop, some EDM and rap into their body of work, addressing love and mental health issues with their music. It just takes watching one of their videos to understand why they became such a global phenomenon. </p>

EXO<p> Meet your new boyfriends. With solid vocals, good-boy-gone-bad vibes, and music videos you won’t be able to stop replaying, EXO has reached the hearts of their fans for a reason…or a few. This group of nine has been on the market for eight years, and charting since the very beginning. </p>

<p> They’ve tried every concept you can imagine—sexy, cute, bad boy, bubbly, etc.—in their capacity to reinvent themselves and always go a little further than the last time.




Red Velvet

<p>With Irene, Seulgi, Wendy, Joy and Yeri, you get the best of both worlds: the sweet and the bold, the sparkly and the sexy, the red and...the velvet? Trust me, they are addictive. The group has been shaking up the charts all over the world for the past three years, always surprising their fans with unexpected new sounds, concepts, and even English versions of their hits.

NCT127

<p>One the the largest K-pop groups, NCT features 21 members, but they do not perform all together. The group is divided into subunits NCT127, NCT U, NCT Dream and WayV. NCT Dream embraces more of a young, bright feel, while NCT U is kind of a special snowflake unit where members rotate based on specific concepts. NCT 127 is considered Seoul’s representative group, while WayV stands as the Chinese group. It may be a bit confusing at the beginning, but once you deep dive into their powerful songs and outstanding videos, you’ll become NCT-ed.</p>
